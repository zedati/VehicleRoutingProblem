# Vehicle Routing Problem

Uses Tabu search to explore list of possible optimal routes.

Use command ```python solver.py``` to run the algorithm.
Adjust the number of iterations using `max_iterations` variable in solver.py.
Number of vehicles set to 25, demand of each node is 1, there's no load restriction for a vehicle.
